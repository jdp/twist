Twist is a shell script that allows you to read new tweets on the CLI.

== Installation

	$ curl http://github.com/jdp/twist/raw/master/twist.sh > ~/bin/twist
	$ chmod +x ~/bin/twist
	$ twist

== Dependencies

Twist relies on cURL and XMLStarlet, and they are both easily obtainable (if
not already installed). cURL is on most package managers, and I know XMLStarlet
is on Synaptic for sure.

	cURL http://curl.haxx.se/
	XMLStarlet http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/
